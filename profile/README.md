## Overview
<details><summary>Why Arch?</summary>

- Arch is an execution platform that unlocks programmability with full Turing-complete functionality without compromising the liquidity and security of the Bitcoin base layer thanks to its trust-minimized and decentralized architecture. 

- Unlike L2s and meta-protocols where users must bridge or wrap their assets and then send the assets to a smart contract, Arch allows users to send their assets directly through the program (Arch smart contracts) invocation without bridging or wrapping first.

- The Arch Network maintains real-time state, allowing for Bitcoin transaction chains to be built up within the Bitcoin mempool. Because these unconfirmed Bitcoin transactions are controlled by the Arch Network distributed keys, the network can be confident that double spends of state transitions will not occur and that all state transitions will eventually be incorporated back into the Bitcoin blockchain, providing finality.
